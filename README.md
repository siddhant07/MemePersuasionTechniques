# MemePersuasionTechniques
In this research, we delve into the intricate challenge of classifying persuasion techniques within memes, a domain where information is deliberately crafted to fulfill specific agendas. Our primary objective is to discern and categorize these persuasive strategies, encompassing both logical fallacies and emotional appeals, present in the amalgamation of textual and visual elements within memes. The hierarchical structure embedded in the classification system introduces an additional layer of complexity to the task, necessitating a nuanced approach. As memes increasingly serve as influential mediums for communication, understanding the underlying mechanisms of persuasion becomes imperative. By addressing this multifaceted task, we contribute to the broader discourse on digital communication, media literacy, and computational linguistics, shedding light on the intricate interplay between textual and visual elements in the propagation of persuasive content within the unique medium of memes.
